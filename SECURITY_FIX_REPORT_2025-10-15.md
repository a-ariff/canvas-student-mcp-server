# Security Fix Report - October 15, 2025

**Project:** Canvas Student MCP Server  
**Owner:** Ariff (<i@ariff.dev>)  
**Branch:** `feature/chatgpt-oauth-and-docs`  
**Production URL:** `https://canvas-mcp-sse.ariff.dev`  
**Report Date:** October 15, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Identified and fixed **3 critical security vulnerabilities** in the Canvas MCP Server that could have exposed Canvas API credentials and caused data leakage between users. All fixes have been deployed to production.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SECURE** - Safe for single-user deployment

---

## Security Issues Discovered

### 1. Public Endpoint Exposing Canvas API Keys (CRITICAL)

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem:**

- The `/public` endpoint accepted Canvas API keys via URL query parameters
- Example: `https://canvas-mcp-sse.ariff.dev/public?canvasApiKey=19765~xxx&canvasBaseUrl=...`
- API keys visible in browser history, server logs, and network monitoring tools
- No authentication required - anyone could use the endpoint

**Impact:**

- Canvas API credentials exposed in plain text
- Potential unauthorized access to Canvas data
- API keys logged in Cloudflare analytics

**Fix Applied:**

- Disabled `/public` endpoint completely
- Returns 403 Forbidden with error message:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "endpoint_disabled",
    "error_description": "Public endpoint disabled for security reasons"
  }
  ```

**Code Changed:**

```typescript
// File: packages/remote-mcp-server-authless/src/index.ts (lines 836-860)
if (pathname === '/public') {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      error: 'endpoint_disabled',
      error_description: 'Public endpoint disabled for security reasons. Use OAuth authentication instead.',
      documentation_url: 'https://github.com/a-ariff/canvas-student-mcp-server'
    }),
    { 
      status: 403,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    }
  );
}
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Test command
curl -s "https://canvas-mcp-sse.ariff.dev/public?canvasApiKey=test&canvasBaseUrl=test"

# Response
{"error":"endpoint_disabled","error_description":"Public endpoint disabled..."}
```

### 2. Canvas API Key Logging in Cloudflare (HIGH)

**Severity:** üü† **HIGH**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem:**

- Canvas API keys were being logged in debug statements
- Example: `console.log(canvasApiKey: ${canvasApiKey})`
- Keys stored in Cloudflare Workers logs
- Accessible to anyone with Cloudflare dashboard access

**Impact:**

- API keys persisted in log storage
- Potential exposure if logs accessed by unauthorized users
- Compliance violation (logging sensitive credentials)

**Fix Applied:**

- Removed all `canvasApiKey` logging statements
- Replaced with redacted placeholders:

  ```typescript
  console.log(`canvasApiKey: [REDACTED]`)
  ```

- Keys never written to logs

**Code Changed:**

```typescript
// File: packages/remote-mcp-server-authless/src/index.ts (line 847)
// Before
console.log(`canvasApiKey: ${canvasApiKey}`);

// After  
console.log(`canvasApiKey: [REDACTED]`);
```

---

### 3. Shared Canvas API Key Across All Users (CRITICAL)

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem:**

- Canvas configuration used single shared API key from environment variable
- Code: `canvasApiKey: this.env?.CANVAS_API_KEY || ""`
- **All OAuth users would see the same Canvas account's data**
- Multi-user architecture fundamentally broken

**Impact:**

- User Alice authenticates ‚Üí sees Owner's Canvas courses (not hers) ‚ùå
- User Bob authenticates ‚Üí sees Owner's Canvas courses (not his) ‚ùå
- **Massive privacy violation** - wrong data shown to users
- Cannot support multiple users safely

**Fix Applied:**

- Removed environment variable usage completely
- Canvas config now returns empty strings:

  ```typescript
  canvasApiKey: ""   // Intentionally empty
  canvasBaseUrl: ""  // Intentionally empty
  ```

- All 12 Canvas tools now return error message instead of using shared key
- Clear explanation to users about multi-user limitation

**Code Changed:**

```typescript
// File: packages/remote-mcp-server-authless/src/index.ts (lines 93-100)

// BEFORE (Dangerous)
const getCanvasConfig = () => {
  return {
    canvasApiKey: this.env?.CANVAS_API_KEY || "",  // ‚ùå Shared across all users
    canvasBaseUrl: this.env?.CANVAS_BASE_URL || ""
  };
};

// AFTER (Secure)
const getCanvasConfig = () => {
  return {
    canvasApiKey: "",  // ‚úÖ Intentionally empty - must come from user auth
    canvasBaseUrl: ""  // ‚úÖ Intentionally empty - must come from user auth
  };
};
```

**User Experience:**
All Canvas tools now show this error:

```
Error: Canvas API credentials not configured.

This MCP server requires per-user Canvas API keys for security.
Multi-user Canvas integration is not yet implemented.

Status: Single-user mode only. Multi-user support coming soon.
See: CRITICAL_ARCHITECTURE_ISSUE.md for details.
```

## Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ What's Secure Now

1. **No public endpoint** - Cannot bypass OAuth authentication
2. **No API key logging** - Credentials never written to logs
3. **No shared Canvas key** - Cannot expose one user's data to others
4. **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** - Industry-standard authentication
5. **HTTPS only** - All communication encrypted
6. **Token expiration** - Access tokens expire after 1 hour

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Single-user Canvas access** - Multi-user not yet implemented
2. **Manual Canvas key setup** - Users must get their own Canvas API key
3. **No Canvas token refresh** - Canvas API keys don't auto-rotate

### üìã Future Work Required (Optional)

If you want to support multiple Canvas users:

**Option 1: Per-User Canvas API Keys** (~6 hours)

- Store each user's Canvas API key with their OAuth token
- Update all 12 Canvas tools to use per-user keys
- Test with multiple Canvas accounts
- See: `CRITICAL_ARCHITECTURE_ISSUE.md` for implementation steps

**Option 2: Canvas OAuth Integration** (~40 hours)

- Implement Canvas OAuth flow for each institution
- Store Canvas OAuth tokens per user
- Auto-refresh Canvas tokens
- More complex but fully automated

## Risk Assessment

### Before Fixes

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

- Public endpoint exposed API keys
- Logs contained sensitive credentials
- Multi-user data leakage possible
- **Cannot safely deploy to public**

### After Fixes  

**Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW**

- No public authentication bypass
- No credential logging
- No multi-user data leakage
- **Safe for single-user or OAuth-only deployment**

### Remaining Risks

**Risk Level:** üü° **MEDIUM** (if multi-user needed)

- Canvas tools disabled (show error message)
- Multi-user Canvas support not implemented
- **Acceptable for single-user use, needs work for multi-user**

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use (Single User)

1. ‚úÖ **Use as-is for personal projects** - OAuth authentication works, Canvas tools disabled
2. ‚úÖ **Document as single-user** - Update README.md to clarify single-user limitation
3. ‚úÖ **Keep monitoring** - Watch Cloudflare logs for any issues

### For Multi-User Deployment

1. ‚è≥ **Implement Option 1** from `CRITICAL_ARCHITECTURE_ISSUE.md`
   - Store per-user Canvas API keys in OAuth tokens
   - Update all Canvas tools to use user's key
   - Test with 2+ Canvas accounts
   - Estimated time: 6 hours

2. ‚è≥ **Alternative: Keep as single-user**
   - Document clearly in README
   - Use for personal/testing only
   - No additional work needed

## Technical Details

### Architecture Before Fix

```
User ‚Üí OAuth Login ‚Üí MCP Server
                        ‚Üì
                   env.CANVAS_API_KEY (shared)
                        ‚Üì
                   Canvas API
                        ‚Üì
                   Owner's Canvas Data (wrong!)
```

### Architecture After Fix

```
User ‚Üí OAuth Login ‚Üí MCP Server
                        ‚Üì
                   Empty Canvas Config
                        ‚Üì
                   Error Message (safe!)
```

### Correct Multi-User Architecture (Future)

```
User A ‚Üí OAuth Login ‚Üí Token + Canvas Key A ‚Üí Canvas API ‚Üí User A's Data ‚úì
User B ‚Üí OAuth Login ‚Üí Token + Canvas Key B ‚Üí Canvas API ‚Üí User B's Data ‚úì
