# Smithery Deployment Status

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025 21:44 UTC
**Status:** ⚠️ AWAITING SMITHERY REBUILD

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ package.json Configuration
**Problems Found:**
- `"private": true` - Blocked publishing
- `"module": "./src/index.ts"` - Pointed to source instead of built file
- No build script for root wrapper

**Fixes Applied:**
```json
{
  "private": false,  // REMOVED - now can be published
  "main": "./dist/index.js",  // CHANGED from module to main, points to built file
  "scripts": {
    "build:wrapper": "tsc",  // ADDED
    "build": "npm run build:wrapper && npm run build:mcp && npm run build:api"  // UPDATED
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ TypeScript Build
- Successfully built dist/index.js from src/index.ts
- Wrapper code compiles cleanly
- Entry point is executable

### 3. ✅ Git Commits
- Commit: `2f02109` - "Fix Smithery deployment configuration"
- Pushed to branch: `fix/smithery-lock-deps`
- Merged to main
- Pushed to `origin/main` at commit `a1ebf1a`

## Current Status

### Verification Checks (as of 21:44 UTC)

**1. Smithery Page:**
```bash
curl https://smithery.ai/server/@a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant
```
**Result:** ❌ Still shows "No deployments found"

**2. Registry Search:**
```bash
npx @smithery/cli search canvas-ai-assistant
```
**Result:** ❌ Timeout / Not found in registry

**3. GitHub Repository:**
- ✅ Latest commit pushed to main
- ✅ package.json fixed
- ✅ Build configuration correct

---

## Why Deployment May Still Be Pending

Smithery rebuilds happen automatically when:
1. Push to default branch (main) - ✅ DONE
2. smithery.yaml exists in root - ✅ EXISTS
3. Package has correct configuration - ✅ FIXED

**Possible reasons for delay:**
1. **Build queue** - Smithery may be processing other builds
2. **Build time** - Complex builds can take 2-5 minutes
3. **Caching** - Smithery may need cache invalidation
4. **Manual trigger needed** - May need to visit smithery.ai and manually trigger

---

## Next Steps to Verify

### Option 1: Wait Longer (Recommended First)
```bash
# Wait another 2-3 minutes, then check again
sleep 180
curl -s https://smithery.ai/server/@a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant | grep -i "no deployments"
```

### Option 2: Manual Trigger via Smithery Website
1. Visit https://smithery.ai
2. Login with GitHub account
3. Navigate to your server: @a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant
4. Look for "Rebuild" or "Deploy" button
5. Click to manually trigger build

### Option 3: Check Build Logs
- Smithery dashboard should show build status
- Check for any build errors
- Verify webhook received push event

---

## Verification Commands

Once deployment succeeds, these should ALL pass:

```bash
# 1. Page should NOT show "No deployments found"
curl -s https://smithery.ai/server/@a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant | grep -v "No deployments found"

# 2. Should appear in search results
npx @smithery/cli search canvas-ai-assistant | grep "@a-ariff"

# 3. Installation should work
npx @smithery/cli install @a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant --dry-run

# 4. Clean environment test
docker run --rm node:20 bash -c "npx @smithery/cli install @a-ariff/canvas-ai-assistant"
```

## What's Different Now vs Before

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **package.json private** | `true` | Removed (false by default) |
| **Entry point** | `module: "./src/index.ts"` | `main: "./dist/index.js"` |
| **Build script** | None for wrapper | `build:wrapper: tsc` |
| **Built output** | No dist/ folder | dist/index.js exists locally |
| **Smithery can build** | ❌ NO - missing config | ✅ YES - all requirements met |

---

## Critical Files

- ✅ `/smithery.yaml` - Runtime typescript, correct config
- ✅ `/package.json` - No private flag, correct main field
- ✅ `/src/index.ts` - Entry point source
- ✅ `/tsconfig.json` - Compiles to dist/
- ✅ `/.gitignore` - Excludes dist/ (Smithery builds it)

---

## Follow the Agent Instructions

See `.claude/AGENT_TASK_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed guidelines on:
- How to properly verify deployments
- What "complete" actually means
- When to claim success vs stay silent
- External system verification protocols

**Key Lesson:** Never claim "deployment complete" until external verification passes:
```bash
curl https://smithery.ai/... # Must NOT show "No deployments found"
npx @smithery/cli install ... # Must succeed
```

---

## Status Summary

**Configuration:** ✅ FIXED
**Build Locally:** ✅ WORKS
**Pushed to GitHub:** ✅ DONE
**Smithery Rebuild:** ⏳ PENDING
**External Verification:** ❌ NOT YET

**DO NOT claim success until Smithery page shows actual deployment info.**

---

**Next Action:** Wait 3-5 minutes and re-check, or manually trigger rebuild via smithery.ai dashboard.
